      <h2>What is Software Engineering?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        &emsp;Software Engineering <span>(SE)</span> is an engineering discipline concerning all aspects of software production,
         including software analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment. SE requires profound abstract 
         and logical thinking and the application of mathematics, logic, and computer science in order to produce 
         efficient and reliable software with the available resources.

      <h2>
        Why Study Software Engineering?
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        &emsp;It is hard to overstate the ubiquity of software nowadays. Every computer system is governed by software. Almost every human activity 
        involves software in some form. Undoubtedly software industry is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in the world. Consequently, 
        skilled software engineers are in high demand worldwide. As software becomes more and more complex, the programming skills and the rudimentary 
        knowledge of software engineering that students obtained from traditional computer science and computer engineering curriculums are insufficient.
         The development of real-world software applications requires the skills in analysing the problem domain and the customer's requirement and the 
         skills in designing the software from the topmost level down to the implementation level. Moreover,
         a software engineer must be able to use proper tools, techniques, and methodologies in order to produce the software in an efficient manner.
